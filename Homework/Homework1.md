    i. Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? 
    
    My Answers:
    The command **head chipotle.tsv** is used to look at the head of the file, and **tail chipotle.tsv** is used to look at the tail. The columns: 
    *order_id* is an integer that indicates a unique order. 
    *quantity* is the number of the particular item which was ordered
    *item_name* is the generic type of item
    *choice_description* indicates the specific details regarding the ordered item



     Rows are each of the individual orders.
