* I am going to use the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 data set. 
* The data set was obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#
* The data set does have missing values
* I chose this data set becuase it looks like a rich data set - it has 55 fields and 100K observations 
* Initially, I will try to predict disposition
* If I am able to complete all of the basic requitements for the project, them I would like to employ the tool in the Mapper module. (I currently do not know how to use the Mapper module) link to Mapper http://danifold.net/mapper/index.html
